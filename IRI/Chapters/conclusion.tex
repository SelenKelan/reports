\chapter{Conclusion}

\label{conclusion}

During this internship at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, I worked for the first time on a simulated environment without applying this work to the physical world.
I had to tackle numerous challenges, from a complete refactoring of the base program that had to be done before I could even begin my work to a lengthy program that I couldn't launch frequently.\\

Far from bothering me, those challenges helped me learn more, and develop new skills. Working in a constrained environment can be a problem, but rising to the challenge makes stronger.\\

Noisy sensors, long calculation times, complex subject, all of those were the challenges to overcome, and not only the simplest way.
Thinking outside the box was necessary and, as always, the best solutions came from where it was least expected.
