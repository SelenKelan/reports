\label{conclusion}

During this internship at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, I worked for the first time on a simulated environement without applying this work to the physical world.
I was met with numerous challenges, from a complete refactoring of the base program that had to be done before I could even begin my work to a lengthy program that I couldn't launch frequently.\\

Far from being a bother, those challenges helped me grow, and nurture new skills. Working in a constrained environement can be a problem, but taken by the right side, can become a strength.\\

Noisy sensors, long calculation times, complex subject, all of those were seen as challenges to overcome, and not only by the simplest way.
Thinking outside the box was necessary and, as always, the best solutions came from where you would expect it the less.
