\chapter{Contributions to the professional project}

\label{apport}


\section{Skills Acquired}
Most of what I learnt during this internship was directly or indirectly linked to technical knowledge in the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
  \item State estimation techniques for autonomous robots using box particle filtering
  \item Trajectory tracking and avoidance strategies
  \item Implementation in the Matlab environment of nominal and robust tracking error methods
  \item Implementation in the Matlab environment of obstacle avoidance methods
\end{itemize}

But, of course, this can’t be the only contribution.
 A great part of what I learnt was related to interpersonal skills in an international environment.
   Although it wasn’t my first trip to a foreign country, it was the first time I had to work outside France.
   And, in Spain, as in many other countries with a strong latin influence, professional and private sphere have blurred boundaries.
This is even more highlighted in laboratory work, were there are no work schedules.\\

As a result, a good part of my work was done in a bar, at home, or any- where with air conditioning.
Discussions with coworkers were free-flowing, and no hierarchical boundaries were felt during these times of exchange.\\

This modus operandi allowed me to greatly improve my conversational and interpersonal skills.

\section{Public Research and Private Business}

I already had a pretty clear view of what I wanted to do after the engineering school, but this experience helped me to precise it even more.

I have a preference for Research and Development, but unfortunately, the free-flowing, even laid back management of a public laboratory is not something I like.
Through my two internships, one at ENSTA Bretagne, and the other at the UPC, I can now say with no doubt that I wouldn't appreciate this kind of working environment.\\

My next internship will take place in a private structure, in order to understand the differences, and maybe validate my choice.
