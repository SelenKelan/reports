\chapter{Economic Impact}

\label{economic}

In public research environment, it's always a bit hard to understand clearly the economic impact of any action.\\

Although no action is clearly aimed at yielding an economic benefit, some may, by chance, bring reputation to the laboratory.
Sadly, it was not the case of the systems I worked on.
But, from what I saw and what I learned from the numerous scientists of the laboratory, a non-negligible number of their work is aimed to other business.\\

Other parts of their works were tailored to participate in competitions such as the ERL or the SEAT autonomous driving challenge.
Participating in those kinds of challenges does not directly bring in money, since the cash prizes are rarely high, but sponsors may be attracted by the teams engaged in those challenges.
Moreover, even just participating will bring recognition to the school.\\

In a nutshell, the economic model of a public research laboratory is far from the one of any company, and works in some kind of closed ecosystem.
